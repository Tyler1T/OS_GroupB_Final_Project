Use struct for train data with binary file
	Each train will be an array with the information

Summary reader should take a struct and maybe return an int for confirmation

Server should return an int as confirmation for what it did (0 or 1)
	Client should use this information to determine what the server will be sending next
	1
		Then there were seats available the client can send back what seats the users wants
	0
		Otherwise the client will tell the user there were no seats available and the server will not expect anything
